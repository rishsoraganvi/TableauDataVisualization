# 🚢 **1️⃣ TITANIC DATASET VISUALIZATION**

### 📘 Dataset Description:
The Titanic dataset provides information about passengers on the RMS Titanic, including age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.  
This visualization explores survival trends and demographic relationships using Tableau.

### 🧭 Steps Performed:
1. **Bar Chart:** Passengers by Gender.  
2. **Stacked Bar Chart:** Survival count by Gender.  
3. **Bar Chart:** Survival rate by Passenger Class.  
4. **Histogram:** Age distribution of passengers.  
5. **Scatter Plot:** Age vs. Fare relationship.  
6. **Box Plot:** Fare distribution by Passenger Class.  
7. **Heat Map:** Survival rate by Gender and Class.  
8. **Pie Chart:** Gender distribution of passengers.  
9. **Dashboard:** Combined interactive view of all visuals for deeper insights.

### 🧩 Key Insights:
- **Female passengers** had a significantly higher survival rate than males.  
- **First-class** passengers had better survival outcomes compared to other classes.  
- **Fare** and **Class** were strongly correlated — higher fares were linked with higher survival chances.  
- Most passengers were within the **20–40 years** age range.

# ☕ **2️⃣ COFFEE CHAIN DATASET VISUALIZATION**

### 📘 Dataset Description:
The Coffee Chain dataset contains sales, profit, marketing, and budget information for a retail coffee business across different states and markets.  
The goal is to analyze business performance and identify high and low profit areas.

### 🧭 Instructions & Tasks Performed:

#### (i) Heat Map — Product Type, State, and Profit  
- Created to visualize profit distribution across different states and product types.  
- Identified states with **lowest profit** for each product category.

#### (ii) Box Plot — Espresso Sales Distribution  
- Visualized sales spread for **Espresso** products to identify variability.

#### (iii) Bar Chart — Product Type, Product, and Profit  
- Compared profit contributions by product and category.

#### (iv) Scatter Plot — State, Sales, and Profit  
- Displayed relationship between sales and profit to find states with high sales but low profit.

#### (v) Identify Highest & Lowest Profit State  
- Ranked all states to highlight top-performing and underperforming ones.

#### (vi) Sales in Nevada for Decaf Espresso  
- Filtered for **State = Nevada** and **Product = Decaf Espresso** to view total sales.

#### (vii) Contribution of Tea to Overall Profit (%)  
- Calculated the percentage contribution of **Tea** products to total profit.

#### (viii) Average Marketing in Area Codes 660 and 818  
- Compared **average marketing spend** in selected area codes.

#### (ix) Highest & Lowest Profit Product in California  
- Analyzed profit performance for products within **California**.

#### (x) Side-by-Side Circles — Minimum Marketing for Coffee Beans (Colombian)  
- Visualized marketing levels for **Colombian Coffee Beans** across markets.

#### (xi) Contribution of Sales in East Market for Decaf  
- Computed % share of **Decaf sales** in the **East Market**.

#### (xii) Contribution of Decaf Sales in East Market (2012)  
- Filtered for **Year = 2012** to identify yearly performance.

#### (xiii) Average Profit for Products Starting with “C”  
- Filtered products starting with “C” and calculated their average profit.

#### (xiv) Central Region — Top 5 Products by Sales  
- Identified and compared **Top 5 selling products** in the **Central region**.

#### (xv) 2013 — Highest Profit State in West Market  
- Filtered for **Year = 2013** and **Market = West** to find the most profitable state.

#### (xvi) Total Expenses-to-Sales Ratio of State with Lowest Profit  
- Created a calculated field to evaluate cost efficiency of low-performing states.

#### (xvii) Distinct Count of Area Codes — Lowest Budget Margin, Small Markets  
- Identified number of distinct area codes for small markets with the lowest margins.

#### (xviii) 2013 — % of Profit for Caffe Mocha (Major Market)  
- Filtered **Year = 2013, Product = Caffe Mocha, Market = Major** to compute contribution.

#### (xix) Month-Year when Decaf Sales Crossed $1,100 (Colorado & Florida)  
- Identified month-year combinations where **Decaf sales exceeded $1,100** in Colorado & Florida.

#### (xx) Tree Map — Market by Budget Sales  
- Created a tree map to identify the **market with maximum budget sales**.
